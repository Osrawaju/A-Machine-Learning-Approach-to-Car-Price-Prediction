# A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Car-Price-Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds an interpretable linear regression model to predict car prices based on vehicle characteristics such as mileage, engine volume, brand, body type, and registration status.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels

## 📊 Project Workflow
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier detection using PDFs
- OLS assumption testing
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Model training and evaluation
- Error and residual analysis

## 📈 Results
- R² Score: **0.745**
- Strong performance for average-priced vehicles
- Reduced accuracy for extreme price ranges

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Try non-linear models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Add more vehicle-specific features
- Hyperparameter tuning
